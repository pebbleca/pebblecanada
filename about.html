                <p>
                  <strong>Pebble Canada</strong> is a Canada founded, globally active solutions organization supporting complex programs across technology, logistics and supply chains, defence capability, and workforce delivery for energy and critical minerals.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Established in <strong>2025</strong>, Pebble Canada was formed to address a recurring gap seen across both public and private sector initiatives: strong strategy and investment intent, but insufficient execution capacity in high consequence operating environments. From day one, the organization was designed around delivery discipline, operational accountability, and the ability to scale capability rapidly across borders and sectors.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Today, Pebble Canada operates with a <strong>global footprint</strong>, supported by a network of <strong>hundreds of consultants, specialists, and delivery professionals</strong> spanning North America, Europe, Asia, and emerging markets. This distributed model allows us to deploy the right expertise at the right time, while maintaining centralized governance, quality control, and client accountability.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We work with government organizations, prime contractors, infrastructure developers, energy operators, manufacturers, and technology providers who operate under real constraints: regulatory oversight, security expectations, labour shortages, supply chain volatility, and tight delivery timelines. Our role is to convert complexity into structured, auditable, and repeatable execution.
                </p>

                <h3>Our Four Pillars</h3>

                    <p>
                      Pebble Canada delivers applied technology solutions focused on operational enablement rather than experimentation. Our work spans automation, data platforms, analytics, and AI driven decision support, implemented with security, governance, and adoption in mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We help organizations modernize systems, improve visibility, and reduce manual overhead while ensuring technology aligns with regulatory, privacy, and operational realities.

                    <p>

                    <p>
